## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

0. **Install Selenium Chromedriver**:
   - To use Selenium with Chrome, you need to install Chromedriver and place it in the "C:/" folder. A video guide on how to do this is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dz59GsdvUF8&t=0s).

1. **Install Python**: This project was tested with Python version 3.9. If you don't have Python 3.9 installed, you can download it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Adding Python to PATH**: Make sure that Python is added to your system's PATH so you can run Python commands from your command prompt. To do this, follow the instructions specific to your operating system:

   - **Windows**:
     - During Python installation, make sure to check the box that says "Add Python X.Y to PATH" (replace X.Y with your Python version).
     - If Python is not in your PATH, you can add it manually by following [these instructions](https://datatofish.com/add-python-to-windows-path/).

   - **Linux** and **macOS**:
     - Python is usually added to PATH by default during installation. You can check this by opening a terminal and running `python --version`. If Python 3.9 is displayed, you're all set.

3. **Start Dependencies**: After Python is installed and added to your PATH, you need to run the `dependencies.bat` script to install the project's dependencies.

## Usage

Once you have completed the installation steps, you can start using the program. Here's how to get started:

1. **Run the Program**: You can run the program by executing the main script. Use the following command in your command prompt - navigate the command prompt to the same path your main.py is at :

- python main.py

*NOTE: YOU MAY HAVE TO CHANGE USERNAME EMAIL PASSWORD AND WEBHOOK TO YOUR LIKING BY MODIFYING MAIN.PY TO DO THIS OPEN IT WITH NOTEPAD AND MODIFY THE STRINGS IN THE FUNCTIONS random_email, random_username and random_password.*

2. **Access Credentials**: All necessary accounts and access credentials are saved in a text file. The program will prompt you to provide any required input, and you can refer to the text file for additional information.
